# Quiz-Game-in-Data-Structure
The Quiz Game Application is a simple yet engaging C-based console program that tests a userâ€™s knowledge through multiple-choice questions. Built as part of a Data Structures project, this quiz game demonstrates how arrays of structures, user input handling, and timing mechanisms work together to create an interactive learning experience.

The game stores questions and answers using structured data types for clarity and scalability. Each question is timed, with a 60-second countdown, adding an extra challenge for the player. Users receive instant feedback for each question, and the game calculates the final score at the end. This foundational implementation is ideal for demonstrating practical C programming concepts and can be enhanced in the future with a GUI, categories, random question selection, or a leaderboard.
